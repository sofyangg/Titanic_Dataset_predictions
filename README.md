# Titanic_Dataset_predictions
i've entered the Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster competition on Kaggle,

instead of dropping the Age column or filling missing values with median Age i decided to train a RandomForestRegressor model that predicts missing values .

i then trained and fine-tuned a RandomForestClassifier model to predict Survivors and scored 77.75/100.

i got placed 3260 of 13570 on the leaderboard.
